# ImageRetrieval_CIFAR-10
## Abstract
This report presents a study on Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) utilizing the CIFAR-10 dataset, focusing on image retrieval through RGB histogram comparisons and Manhattan Distance calculations. It encapsulates the methodology, implementation, and findings from the study.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop and analyze a CBIR system leveraging the CIFAR-10 dataset, a benchmark in image processing and machine learning for algorithm evaluation. This report outlines the dataset details, retrieval approach, and the applicability of the employed techniques.

## Methodology
The CIFAR-10 dataset, comprising 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, etc.), was utilized. The methodology section elaborates on the data preparation, RGB histogram computation, and similarity measurement through Manhattan Distance.

## Implementation
Implementation was carried out in Python, using libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. The process involved loading the dataset, preprocessing images, computing histograms, and calculating image similarities. This section discusses the implementation challenges and solutions.

## Results and Discussion
Here, the results of the image retrieval system are presented along with a discussion on system performance, method effectiveness, and an analysis of notable cases of success and failure.

## Conclusion
The report concludes by summarizing the study's accomplishments, reflecting on the learning outcomes,and suggesting avenues for further research and improvement in CBIR systems.
